<h1>corvix GNU/Linux</h1>
<i>The distribution / webpage is under heavy development. Don't use, yet.</i>
<br>
In our environment we already have it running, but we have to stabilize it
for the first release. We are expecting a first useable release in the first week of august.


<h2>What is corvix?</h2>

Corvus corvax likes to steal; this distribution steals ideas :) 
In fact it's less a distribution and more a cheat sheet for installing 
debian in a scientific environment. After you install the
corvix distribution, you have a debian/etch with additional
features.


<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>Motivation</h3>
Usually in a scientific environment one likes to have a stable 
base system (this also could be FreeBSD) and then only update 
a couple of really important packages to the bleeding edge.
Here, debian is chosen as the basis system. The corvix
distribution will install a straight debian/etch with a set
of common packages selected.


<h3>Concept</h3>
<ul>
   <li>advanced user
   <li>textmode
   <li>full documentation: download git source tree, and
      read <pre>/doc</pre>
</ul>


<h2>Package Management</h2>

<h3>Egatrop</h3>
The toolset egatrop has been developed. It provides
ebuilds, which do not check anything at all (like Gentoo ;)
and rely on the automake tools. You may better compare it to
slackware. Egatrop is completely independent on corvix.
You can compile all your custom stuff yourself with these
small cheatsheets with one command! All stuff resides
in /opt/egatrop.

<h4>Using egatrop separately</h4>
...


<h2>Installation</h2>
The installation procedure is done over network. You may download
a bunch of scripts, which will build the bootable CD, USB stick
or setup a PXE boot server for you. If you want to save bandwidth
you may also choose to setup a mirror for the packages;
this can be a webserver, a CD or any other storage medium you
may access during the installation.

<h3>Features of the installer</h3>
Linux is about choice. Here, we restrict the features strictly
to some working configurations:
<ul>
   <li>Workstation
      <ul>
         <li>debootstrapped debian/etch
         <li>usual debian/etch bootcd
      </ul>
   <li>Cluster modes:
      <ul>
         <li>Head server
         <li>Nodes: will install within under 4 minutes.
      </ul>
</ul>
Everything you want to do different: you can work as usual
with debian. For custom compiled stuff have a look at the
ebuilds.


<h3>Obtaining the software</h3>
Download the source 
<ul>
   <li><a href="http://gitweb.corvix.eu/gitweb.cgi?p=corvix;a=snapshot">Snapshot</a>
   <li>Not yet public: git clone git.corvix.eu/git/corvix
</ul>
Egatrop can be downloaded seperately including ebuilds.
<ul>
   <li><a href="http://gitweb.corvix.eu/gitweb.cgi?p=egatrop;a=snapshot">Snapshot</a>
   <li>Not yet public: git clone git.corvix.eu/git/egatrop
</ul>
All software needed to build the source iso is mirrored here
<ul>
   <li><a href="http://mirror.corvix.eu">mirror.corvix.eu</a>
</ul>


<h3>Howto install?</h3>
...

<h4>Building the boot iso image</h4>
You have to build a boot iso image at first:
<pre>
cd lib/install
./do
</pre>
and the new boot image will reside in <tt class=file>~/corvix.iso</tt>.
If you have <tt class=file>qemu</tt> installed you may test the image using
<pre>
./testbootiso
</pre>

<h4>Building a boot stick</h4>
<h4>Building a pxe bootserver</h4>
<h4>Mirror options</h4>
<ul>
   <li>local (nfs, hdd, cd)
   <li>mirror.corvix.eu
</ul>




<h3>Preconfigures installation profiles</h3>

<h4>debian/etch</h4>

<h4>debian/etch preseef</h4>

<h4>corvix</h4>

<h4>corvix - cluster head server</h4>

<h4>corvix - cluster node</h4>
