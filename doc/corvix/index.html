<h1>What is corvix?</h1>

Corvus corvax likes to steal; this distribution steals ideas :) 
In fact it's less a distribution and more a cheat sheet for installing 
debian in a scientific environment. After you install the
corvix distribution, you have a debian/etch with additional
features.

<h2>Motivation</h2>
Usually in a scientific environment one likes to have a stable 
base system (this also could be FreeBSD) and then only update 
a couple of really important packages to the bleeding edge.
Here, debian is chosen as the basis system. The corvix
distribution will install a straight debian/etch with a set
of common packages selected.

<h2>Concept</h2>

<h2>Egatrop</h2>
The toolset egatrop has been developed. It provides
ebuilds, which do not check anything at all (like Gentoo ;)
and rely on the automake tools. You may better compare it to
slackware. Egatrop is completely independent on corvix.
You can compile all your custom stuff yourself with these
small cheatsheets with one command! All stuff resides
in /opt/egatrop.

<h2>Features of the installer</h2>
Linux is about choice. Here, we restrict the features strictly
to some working configurations:
- Cluster modes
   - Head server
   - Nodes
- Workstation
Everything you want to do different: you can work as usual
with debian. For custom compiled stuff have a look at the
ebuilds.
